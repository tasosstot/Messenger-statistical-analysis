## Facebook Analysis with Python and Pandas ## 
### Overview ###
In this project, we analyze the basic statistics of Messenger chat history. Facebook provides a JSON file containing all your chats in Messenger, including timestamps, message content, author information, and reactions. By using Python and pandas, we can collect statistical data and visualize it in bar charts.

### Information Collected ###
#### We focus on the following metrics: ####

1. Number of messages
2. Number of words
3. Most frequently used words
4. Reactions

### Getting Started ###
1. #### Download Your Messenger Chat History: ####
   - Obtain the JSON file of your Messenger chat. You can find instructions on how to download it here.
2. #### Project Structure: ####
    - The Code folder in this repository contains the projectâ€™s code in both ``` .py ``` and ```  .ipynb ```  formats.
    - To get instant results, run the ``` .ipynb ``` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    -  Make sure to rename the input file (e.g., ``` with open("message_1_gtms.json", "r", encoding="unicode-escape") as file:) ```  with your own JSON file.
    - The second folder contains the results in JPEG and Excel formats.
